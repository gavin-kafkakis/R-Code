#question e
#the null hypotehesis of this test is whether group a or b would be better, and whether or not 
# we would reject or fail to reject the results 

# question f 
t.test(a$CTR)
t.test(b$CTR)

# question g 
# yes the results show that the results are statistically significant 

# question h 
# it is showing that group b won the test
