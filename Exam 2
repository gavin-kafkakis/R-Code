#question 2 
pet_politics <- table(states$Top_Pet, states$Governor)
pet_politics

chisq.test(pet_politics)
#theres seems to not be a relationship between our two variables of pets and governors.  This is due to the fact 
# that our p-value for these variables is 0.4298 which is well above our threshold of 0.05.  This shows that 
# we can reject the hypothesis and therefore show that there is not much of relationship between these two variables.

#question 3

#question 4 
states_grouped <- group_by(state_ranking, Region)

#question 5 
#part a 
qplot(Happiness_Score, Diversity_Score, data=state_ranking, 
      geom = "point", color = Happiness_Score) + xlim(c(25,75)) + ylim(c(55,75))

cor.test(state_ranking$Happiness_Score, state_ranking$Diversity_Score)
# when looking at the correlation test we can see that there is not much of a correlation at all if any it 
# would be more of a positively correlation.  Our correlation value is 0.30 which is not a strong correlation, 
# but would be positive, and when looking at our graph we can see that it shows as more psoitive.  But also can 
# see with the graph that the correlation between the two of them is not very strong.  

#part b 
score_model <- lm(Overall_Score~Percent_Poverty+Universities+Covid_Rate+Diversity_Score+
                    Beach, data=state_ranking)
summary(score_model)
# it looks like for this problem that covid rate and diversity score are our most signiificant variables and universities 
# is somewhat significant as it is right outside of our threshold.  When looking at our significant variables it 
# looks like covid rate will have a negative impact on our overall score and that the diversity score will
# have a very big impact on our score as for an increase in that it goes up by almost 1.  


# part c 
state_ranking$Republican_Binary <- ifelse(state_ranking$Republican_Score >= 50, 1, 0)

republican_model <- glm(Republican_Binary~Density+Incarceration_Rate+Governor, data=state_ranking)
summary(republican_model)
# In this model the density and the governor being republican are significant varibles for this model.  
# The p values for both of those variables are both under the 0.05 threshold showing that they are significant 
# variables for predicting if they over 50 republican.  The density has a negative impact on the binary variable
# and the governor has a very postitive impact on the target. 


state_ranking$Beach_Binary <- ifelse(state_ranking$Beach == "TRUE", 1, 0)

beach_model <- glm(Beach_Binary~Density+Happiness_Score+Minimum_Wage+Diversity_Score, data=state_ranking)
summary(beach_model)

# the density score is the only variable that has a significant impact on if the state has a beach.  This is 
# due to it being the only variable being below the 0.05 threshold for the p value.  With its coefficent being 
# positive it has a positive impact on if the state has the chance of having a beach.
