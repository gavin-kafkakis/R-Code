summary(all_state)
# within car age for this summary we can see that we have some upper outliers as 25 percent of our upper data 
# is going to be located between 11 and 74.  What we can also see is that a lot of our data is going to be around 
# the same age area which could be good for our problems we need to solve as 75 percent is between 0 and 11.

summary(fit)

# with the distribution of the car age, we can see that most of our age is going to be located right around that year 5, 
# we can also see that there are a couple of outliners, but once we get past 20, the amount of cars will decrease. This would 
# mean that the graph would be right skewed as most of our data will be on the left side of our graph.  
# within our linear model we can see that there is first a negative correlation between car age and the cost 
# of the car.  With our linear model we see that our formula would be equal to y = 703.1559 - 2.2639(age) - our car value 
# this means that with every increase in one year we lose 2.2639 dollars off of our cost.
